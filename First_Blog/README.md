And I was like oh okay…something really good is going to happen! I accepted the alacrity to write a blog on Data Science, So I chose to work on Face Detection!  
 - Dataset — sufficient to test our model!  
### How many people are there in this Image? Hell of task to count one by one…

## but not for AI Models!

### Where can we use it in Real-Life Application?  
 - In-School/Colleges to Detect Faces and further user Face Recognition to mark Attendance!  
 - In Offices or Data Centres where restricted people are required to enter.  
 - Republic-Day Parade to Detect Face from such a large crowd and find felonies!  
## Business Approach?  
 - For Government — Collection of Data, Encrypting it, taking care of privacy concerns, and further helping in maintaining the law and order of states!  
 - For Private Companies — Oh! common Data is everything for them!  
# Future Work:  
 - So, What’s next after Face Detection…Face Verification?  
 - I am on it, stick around with my blog posts by following me on medium and I will soon make a Face Recognition System using Flask and Various Deep Learning Models for Faster Detection and Verification.  
 - And How about even Deploying it on AWS or Python Anywhere?
