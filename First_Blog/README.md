# Project Face Detection!
## How to run the code?!  
Clone the repository  if you want to run on localhost and if you plan to run on colab follow the same steps
### For Jupyter Notebook on localhost  
open CMD (Windows) or Terminal (Ubuntu/Mac)  
type  -> jupyter notebook in CMD  
 - press enter  
 - git clone https://github.com/NightFury010497/Udacity_Data_Scientist_NanoDegree  
 - cd Udacity_Data_Scientist_NanoDegree/First_Blog/  
 - click on -> retinaface_detection.ipynb
FOR COLAB USERS:
 - Go To FILE 
 - Open Notebook
Structure of files
 - Models.zip contains the reference python files to the model!
 - data.zip contains the data which contains some sample images 

### INTRODUCTION
**Can a camera do more than just being a camera?  
Can I find my best friend in the stadium full of people?  
Can I find a terrorist in a crowd?  
Answer to all these questions is just one word - YES!**
### Dataset - And where to Find!! (DATA Gathering and Preparation)  
 → [DATASET ZOO](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/wiki/Dataset-Zoo) ←  
There are so many Datasets available on which you can test my code, make your own code, send a pull request to me, and a LOT more than that! For our model, we **do not** require any preprocessing work to be done for ingesting the images in our model!  
### PreTrained Model and why to use them!  
In my code, I am using the Pretrained model to help solve a similar problem which is FACE DETECTION in our case.  
Instead of building a model from scratch to solve a similar problem, we use the model trained on other problems as a starting point.  
### How many people are there in this Image? Hell of task to count one by one…

## but not for AI Models!

### Where can we use it in Real-Life Application? OR Business Idea's where You can Pitch them Tomorrow!!
 - In-School/Colleges to Detect Faces and further user Face Recognition to mark Attendance!  
 - In Offices or Data Centres where restricted people are required to enter.  
 - Republic-Day Parade to Detect Face from such a large crowd and find felonies!  
 - For Government - Collection of Data, Encrypting it, taking care of privacy concerns, and further helping in maintaining the law and order of states!  
 - For Private Companies - Oh! common Data is everything for them!  
### Conclusion
We can detect as many as faces we want using RETINA NET, whether it is a felony, your curiosity, even your best friend on a television! 
# Future Work:  
 - So, What’s next after Face Detection…Face Verification?  
 - I am on it, stick around with my blog posts by following me on medium and I will soon make a Face Recognition System using Flask and Various Deep Learning Models for Faster Detection and Verification.  
 - And How about even Deploying it on AWS or Python Anywhere?
